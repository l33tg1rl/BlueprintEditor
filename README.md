# BlueprintEditor

Features to add:

- Highlight voxel on mouse over
- Add Paint tool
- Abstract saving and loading blueprints. I don't want the View to know about the Blueprint object and I don't want the view model to necessarily care where blueprints are saved and loaded from.
- Improve the lighting. It's hard to see the voxels at certain angles
